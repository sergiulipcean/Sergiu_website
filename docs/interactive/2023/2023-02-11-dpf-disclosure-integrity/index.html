<p><br> Note: The plot depicts the relationship between the public funding of elections (higher values - more public funding), disclosure of campaign donations (higher values - more comprehensive disclosure), on the one hand, and electoral integrity (higher values - freer and fairer elections), on the other hand. Additionally, it breaks down this relationship by the level of democratic development (point colour and size). More generous public funding of elections and more more demanding disclosure requirements for campaign donations are associated with freer and fairer electoral competition. Likewise, more democratic regimes provide more state support to political parties and require more transparency for campaign donations. Data reflects expert opinions. Use the mouse to rotate/spin, zoom in, and hover over the plot for more details.
