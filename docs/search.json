    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post, I discuss and replicate Hummel et al. (2021). Their article is perhaps the most ambitious effort to estimate the effect of public funding on political corruption in terms of geographical and temporal coverage. The article stands out from other cross-national studies on the relationship between party financing and corruption due to the authors’ efforts to construct a Political Finance Subsidy Index (PFSI) covering “175 countries and 115 years, generating 12,380 country-year observations” (Hummel et al., 2021, pag., 6), which is truly impressive. However, unlike Casal Bértoa et al. (2014), who rely on a public funding measure reflecting somewhat closer the level of funding political parties receive from the state, PFSI represents a much weaker measure. It represents an aggregate measure of five dichotomous (no = 0, yes = 1) indicators.\nThis is a critical issue since the index does not tell us to what extent political parties rely on the state to fund their activities. Hence it only indicates whether a certain type of regulation is present or not. Before replicating the analysis, I will focus a bit on measurement issues since the PFSI has a few other weaknesses that might affect the results.\n      First, it is redundant because two out of five indicators measure whether the regulations on state subsidies are implemented. Hence, roughly 40% of the data is duplicated. While there might be cases where DPF is foreseen by law but not implemented, these cases are rare. Unlike other dimensions of political financing regulations such as donation and spending limits or transparency obligations, public funding is an entitlement, not a burden and political parties are highly motivated to get money from the public purse, thus, they are interested in implementing the provision of state subsidies. That is why the two PFSI sub-indicators on implementation are redundant.\n      Second, Hummel et al. (2021) code campaign subsidies in the same way as regular party subsidies, which is not appropriate. Why so? Unlike public funding for statutory party activities, which is provided on an annual basis, electoral subsidies are provided only during election years. However, the authors code electoral subsidies on annual basis. Hence, if one considers that elections are organised on average once in four years, roughly 75% of country-year observations for countries providing electoral subsidies are miscoded for two out of five indicators, which is a lot.\n      Third, the accuracy of coding for many countries is problematic. While the authors claim that they rely on various sources and country experts and provide in the online appendix data sources, many countries are miscoded. Since my research focuses on party financing in post-communist space, I verified only 27 post-communist countries after 1990 from their dataset for which I have very precise data on public funding. I found that more than half of post-communist regimes are miscoded for different periods. For instance, Moldova effectively introduced public funding for party statutory activities (organisational funding) only in 2016, while Hummel et al. (2021) code it as having public funding from 1991. Likewise, Slovak political parties benefited from public funding both for party statutory and election activities from the early ’90 when Slovakia was part of Czechoslovakia and preserved the system of state subsidies after it became independent in 1993. However, in Hummel et al. (2021) dataset it is coded as having introduced public funding only in 2005. There are other issues related to operationalisation of PFSI, however, I will not discuss them here. Nevertheless, the shortcomings highlighted above raise legitimate doubts on data quality based on which one makes policy recommendations in a critical area of democratic governance.\n      As corruption measure, they use the political corruption index from the Varieties of Democracy dataset (V-DEM) (Coppedge et al., 2018), which is the only index with time coverage going back in time so far. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the PFSI and V-DEM corruption index. As one may notice, the relationship between PFSI and corruption is not strictly linear.\nFigure 1: Relationship between PFSI and political corruption\nUsing different panel data models, Hummel et al. (2021) found that higher values of the PFSI reduce corruption perception. Below, I replicate their analysis from the model 3 (full model) of table 3 (pag.14) in their study, which is a two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) model. In addition, I conduct the analysis on different subsets of regionally-split data. This will allow me to see whether the negative effect of corruption holds across different regions. If PFSI has a consistent negative effect on corruption, one would expect it to be more or less similar across different regions. To keep things simple, I present the results for the PFSI only, without other control variables, even though I include them into the estimation. Figure 2 shows significant variation in the regional PFSI coefficients.1\nFigure 2: Effect of Political Finance Subsidy Index on corruption by region\nAs one may notice, the global negative results are driven by four regions: post-communist regimes, MENA, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions. Interestingly, the negative effect of PFSI is statistically significant at 95% only for the MENA region, while for the post-communist polities and the Caribbean they are significant at 90%. For all other regions above the “Entire World”, the effect of PFSI on corruption is positive, although only for East Asia it is statistically significant. This variation casts doubts on the Hummel et al. (2021) analysis. A considerable challenge in this respect is to explain why public funding curbs corruption in some instances while in others it fails to accomplish this task."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the previous blogpost, I argued that binary indicators of party funding such presence vs absence of public funding, donation or spending caps are poor proxies to use in research assessing the impact of financing regulations on political competition, corruption, or other phenomena of interest. The same applies to aggregate indexes of party and campaign funding, which combine different regulatory dimensions (donation caps + spending caps + public funding + transparency) and derive a composite measure through their addition or some alternative procedure. Since comparative cross-national data of party and campaign funding is difficult to obtain, there is a tendency to use expert-based evaluations of different aspects, such as the significance of public funding for the election campaign of parties and candidates or the fairness in the distribution of campaign subsidies. Yet, the critical challenge these measures face is their validity – how accurately expert assessments capture the actual situation. The analysis of two such indexes against real data reveals a rather low validity. Figure 1 presents the results.1 In the left-hand panel, I correlate my data on the public funding level (Lipcean, 2021) with the expert scores average for the question from the Varieties of Democracy dataset “Is significant public inancing available for parties’ and/or candidates’ campaigns for national office?” (ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no subsidies) to 4 (significant subsidies)) (Coppedge et al., 2020; Coppedge et al., 2021). In the right-hand panel, I correlate my data on the legal requirements to get access to campaign subsidies with the expert scores average from the “Electoral Integrity Project” for the question “Parties/candidates had equitable access to public political subsidies?” (ordinal scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 5 (strong agreement)) (Norris & Grömping, 2019a, 2019b). As one may notice, the relationship between actual indicators of public funding and expert assessments produce a considerable mismatch, indicating that expert judgements must be treated cautiously in research on political financing.\nFigure 1: Relationship between expert scores, subsidy level and payout threshold\nThe above examples show that, as the regulation-based indicators or composite measures, expert evaluations are not valid proxies for the public funding mechanism. Hence, the question is whether one can identify better proxies that can be used by scholars in comparative research assessing the role of public funding in politics. In fact, there is one measure, labelled as state dependency (Casal Bértoa et al., 2014). It reflects the share of state funding in the structure of party income. The higher the share of public funding, the higher the rate of state dependency. Considering that it is a measure derived from real data on public funding, it should be a better measure. While this is true, state dependency might still be a biased measure compared to the actual amount of subsidies per vote. Why so? The main reason is that the the amount of public funding could affect its own share in the structure of party income. The higher the level of state financial support to parties, the lower the incentives to seek private contributions. Moreover, state dependency could still hide considerable variation in public funding per vote despite similar shares in the structure of party income across countries.\n      To test whether this is the case, one needs both measures: subsidies per vote and the state dependency rate. Unfortunately, I do not have data on the state dependency rate for post-communist regimes, given the lack of reliable data on private financing. Therefore, I borrow data from other cross-national studies that provide both indicators Nassmacher (2009). The relationship between subsidies per vote and state dependency, presented in Figure 2, depicts a mixed picture.2 Although subsidies per vote and state dependency are positively associated, the strength of the relationship is not sufficient to make them exchangeable.\nFigure 2: Relationship between the level of DPF per voter and the share of DPF in the structure of party income\nAs one could notice, expert-based indices are poor substitutes to objective indicators of political financing. While much better, still the degree of state dependence is not sufficiently precise to be used as a substitute to the actual level of public funding. This evidence warns against the blind employment of such measurements to study political finance from a comparative perspective."

    "text": "This overview represents a brief and somewhat technical discussion of my article published in Party Politics concerning the validity and reliability of various proxy measures of political financing regulations (PFR) and direct public funding (DPF) of political parties (Lipcean, 2021). Scholars commonly employ such proxies to assess their impact on political competition, party system stability, emergence and success of new parties, or political corruption. However, one legitimate concern relates to the suitability of these measures to investigate and gauge the effect of party and campaign funding rules on the phenomena and processes mentioned above. Another justified concern touches on the extent to which these proxies reflect the content of PFR.\n      Considering that the money-politics relationship in contemporary democracies became a vividly debated topic, these concerns are not trivial. Therefore, when researchers develop and use such measures and make policy recommendations on the direction of political finance reforms based on their findings, it is paramount that they reflect the lay of the land of PFR. Moreover, the performance of such proxies in capturing the nature of PFR is particularly relevant since, in most cases, political finance reforms are designed to level the playing field among electoral competitors, minimise the risk of corruption or undue influence on policy-making via party and campaign contributions. Hence, the way how researchers arrive at conclusions regarding the best tools to address the democratic malaise stemming from the disproportionate influence of vested interests on the decision-making process is crucial for the validity of their findings and recommendations.\n      In a nutshell, I argue that when it comes to large-N cross-national studies assessing the effect of PFR/DPF on political competition or corruption, unfortunately, scholars mostly resort to proxy measures that do not capture the reality and complexity of PFR accurately. Thus, such measures are not as good as they could be, given the actual content of PFR. This limitation is determined by the overwhelming reliance on what I call regulatory scope. By contrast, I argue that besides regulatory scope, one also needs to look at regulatory intensity or depth.\n      To understand the difference between the two, I provide a simple example, which will illustrate my point. For instance, when someone analyses the impact of donations or public funding of political parties on corruption or the impact of campaign spending limits on the electoral playing field through the lenses of regulatory scope, she will only consider whether there are (or not) donation and spending limits or whether the state provides (or not) public funds to parties or candidates. Conversely, the focus on regulatory intensity goes further. It is concerned with how much a donor can contribute, a party or candidate can spend, or public funds are granted to political parties to alleviate their fundraising burden. Although the advantages of regulatory intensity against the regulatory scope are self-evident, the former is rarely used in large-N cross-national research on party funding.\n      Below, I provide an illustration based on my dataset on direct public funding of political parties covering 27 post-communist regimes over three decades of transition 1990-2020.1 Hence, I will go through a few indicators to illustrate that regulatory scope is insufficient to understand how permissive a PFR is in limiting the manoeuvring room of political parties and candidates to amass and spend money for their regular or campaign activities. Most charts are adapted based on the article’s figures.\n      Before that, however, I will illustrate that post-communist polities used various methods to determine the level of state subsidies. The choice of a given method might affect the predictability of institutional settings within which political competition occurs. Likewise, it might affect the discretion of political office holders to manipulate the rules in their favour in terms of amount, access and distribution of state funding. More stable and predictable rules on public funding create more equal conditions for electoral competition. By contrast, the lack of or vague regulation enables incumbents to manipulate the allocation mechanism more easily to achieve their electoral goals. Hence, based on the method of determining the level of direct state support to parties, post-communist polities can be clustered into three generic categories based on:\nFigure 1 illustrates the DPF level by method and activity type. The boxplot width shows the number of observations, which means that in most cases, post-communist regimes opted to set the DPF level based on a dynamic economic indicator. Likewise, this method seems to be associated with the most generous funding, although for the statutory party financing, those countries that employed an ad-hoc method provided, alike, quite generous state funding to parties.\nFigure 1: Variation in the DPF level across post-communist regimes by the method and timeframe 1990-2020\nAnother shortcoming of regulatory scope is that it cannot account for the variation in DPF when the state provides subsidies for party statutory and election activities. Generally speaking, there are three scenarios in this respect: the state grants subsidies, either for party routine operations or electioneering activities, or both. Yet, the amount of budgetary resources allotted for each type might differ substantially. For instance, the government could provide regular and election subsidies, albeit the total support might still be minimal. Conversely, the aggregate funding might be very generous even though only one subsidy type is granted.\n      Figure 2 illustrates well this situation. It shows the relationship between the subsidy level for party statutory and election activities. As one may notice, all scenarios are present in different combinations. In some cases, like Montenegro and the Czech Republic, both kinds of subsidies are generous. In others, such as Estonia, Bulgaria or Slovenia, statutory funding has precedence over election financing. By contrast, election funding has priority over regular financing in Slovakia and, more recently, in Hungary.\nFigure 2: Relationship between the DPF level for party statutory and election financing in election years 1990-2020\nBesides the failure to capture these differences, any proxy measure reflecting only the regulatory scope will also fail to account for within-country variation in public funding. Hence, a subsidy increase or decrease over time will remain unnoticed by a dichotomous indicator (0 – absence of subsidies, 1 – presence of subsidies) or a composite measure including public funding. For instance, the changes in the level of state support might affect the incentive structure of political parties or candidates to engage in corruption. To understand the risks of relying on the regulatory scope alone, Figure 3 presents the public funding evolution and change over time from the early ’90 until 2020. Once again, data reveal a tremendous cross-national and within-country variation.\nFigure 3: Cross-national and within-country change in public funding between 1990-2020\nThe purpose of this brief sketch was to warn about the risks entailed by the reliance on various proxies used in comparative research on party finance. As data shows, such proxies are inaccurate and biased in reflecting the actual amount of budgetary subventions provided by the state to political parties, which also applies to other dimensions of political financing such as donation and spending limits. In the next part I will show how alternative proxies such as expert evaluations cannot replace objective indicators."

    "title": "The world upside down: delegitimising political finance regulation employing alternative corruption indices",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post, I replicate one of a few comparative cross-national studies on the effect of political financing regulations on political corruption (Casal Bértoa et al., 2014).1 In a nutshell, the title of the paper suggests that political financing regulations (PFR) do not live up to our expectations in reducing political corruption. Despite the normative belief that more party and campaign financing regulations should diminish political corruption, the authors come to a rather pessimistic conclusion. They do not find evidence that donation caps, public funding of political parties or punishments for financing-related breaches diminish corruption.\n      Of course, their findings represent a heavy blow to policymakers’ efforts to curb political corruption by restricting the inflows and outflows of political money. The most disappointing result in their study relates to the lack of any curbing effect of state funding. This result is even more disappointing considering the fact that authors use a rather good instrument for measuring public funding of parties - state dependency rate. Here, state dependency represents the proportion of state subsidies in the structure of party income, which means the amount of money political parties receive directly from the state budget for running their regular and electoral activities. One would expect that the more funding parties get from the public purse, the less they will be tempted to ask for illegal funding, thus the lower the probability of getting entangled in corrupt transactions. Hence, Casal Bértoa et al. (2014) test this argument using information on state dependency rate, but fail to confirm this expectation.\n      Yet, while they have a pretty good indicator of public funding, the corruption measure they selected is a more specific one - citizens perception of how corrupt political parties are from the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) conducted by Transparency International. While nothing is wrong with choosing this indicator, one issue in many corruption studies is that the results might be considerably affected by the choice of corruption index. Although many corruption indices are highly correlated, this is not always the case when the index reflects citizens’ not experts’ perceptions about political corruption. This is why I replicate this study but also use alternative corruption measures. Among these alternatives, I look at some older indices widely used in cross-national research on corruption, such as the Corruption Perception Index (Transparency International) (CPI), Control of Corruption index (World Bank Governance Indicators) (WBGI) or International Country Risk Guide, and newer ones including political corruption index (V-DEM) from the Varieties of Democracies dataset (Coppedge et al., 2021; Maerz et al., 2021) and the Bayesian Corruption index (BCI) (Standaert, 2015). As Figure 1 shows, the correlation between almost all expert-based perception indices for countries used in Casal Bértoa et al. (2014) analysis is astonishingly high. But all of them display a visibly lower correlation with the GCB index.\nFigure 1: Relationship between different corruption indices in 2011\nSince several corruption indices display a very high correlation, I drop them and use for replication only those that display a lower correlation with GCB and between themselves: GCB, V-DEM, ICRG and BCI. Additionally, I normalise and standardise corruption indices to make their interpretation easier because they are on different scales. The replication’s results regarding the effect of public funding (state dependency) on political corruption are presented in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: Effect of state dependency on corruption by employing alternative corruption indices\nAs one may notice, for the GCB and ICRG corruption indices, the effect is positive (more public funding is associated with a higher corruption perception). In contrast, while for V-DEM and BCI indices, the effect is negative (more public funding is associated with a lower corruption perception). However, these results are not statistically significant, which implies that state dependency (public funding of parties) does not affect the level of political corruption. The null effect can also be seen in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Marginal effects of state dependency on corruption\nTo conclude, I replicate the study of Casal Bértoa et al. (2014) by employing alternative corruption indices. My findings confirm their main result - state dependency rate has no effect on political corruption perception, which casts doubts on the effectiveness of state subsidies as an anti-corruption tool. Nevertheless, one should not forget that corruption perception does not equate with corruption experience, that is, actual incidence of corruption related to party and campaign funding. Therefore, one needs better corruption indicators to assess the impact of state assistance to political parties on their corrupt behaviour."

    "title": "Public Funding of Political Parties Is Unlikely To Reduce Corruption",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This blogpost was originally published on the Global Anticorruption Blog and is republished below.1\n      Does public funding of political parties reduce corruption? Intuitively, there are good reasons to believe that it does. After all, when parties receive a substantial portion of their funding from public sources, they are less dependent on private contributions—both legal and illegal. That straightforward logic has led many scholars and prestigious organizations to recommend higher levels of public funding for parties and candidates. The Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers, for example, recommends public funding of political parties and electoral candidates as an anticorruption measure, and the OECD, while not explicitly using the language of corruption, recommends public funding as part of a holistic system of political finance regulation to limit policy capture.\nBut the empirical evidence on the anticorruption impact of public funding for parties is surprisingly thin, and results that initially seem to show the sort of effect described above often turn out to be quite fragile and unreliable. We recently published our own study, which examines how the level of public funding for political parties affects enterprise managers’ perceptions of the impact of payments to government officials, using EBRD and World Bank survey data from 27 post-communist countries. Although we find an association between higher public funding and lower corruption, this result is extremely sensitive to minor changes in method, and the results are too uncertain to recommend public funding as a policy intervention to reduce corruption.\nWe suspect that one of the reasons that empirical research has failed to find robust anticorruption effects of public funding is that many of the unlawful payments to politicians are used for their personal consumption, rather than for political purposes. As noted above, the economic logic of the view that public funding reduces corruption is that if parties can rely more on public funding for election campaigns and other legitimate political expenses, they will be less tempted to accept bribes, because they will have less need to fill their campaign coffers with dirty money. But if much of the illegal money given to politicians is used for their personal gratification, rather than for political purposes, than public funding of campaigns will not have much of an effect.\nThis is not to say that countries should not significantly increase public funding of political parties. Corruption is enormously damaging, and even very high levels of public funding for parties are unlikely to have much impact on most national budgets, so even the possibility that significant public funding might reduce corruption, at least in some contexts, may make this investment of resources worthwhile, even if we lack strong direct evidence of effectiveness. And of course there are many other reasons, besides anticorruption, to favor public funding of political campaigns. That said, an honest appraisal of the existing research compels the conclusion that, to date, the evidence that public funding will substantially reduce corruption is weak and speculative, and we should therefore not get too excited about its potential as a general anticorruption measure."

    "text": "Evolution of party registration requirements\n      Moldova’s journey in regulating party registration reveals a significant shift from liberal to restrictive requirements. When the Law on Parties and Other Socio-Political Organizations (LPSOP) was adopted in 1991, the registration process required only 300 signatures (Monitorul Oficial, Nr. 11-12, art. 106, 1991). However, the 1998 amendment marked a dramatic change, increasing the requirement to 5,000 members and introducing territorial distribution requirements (Monitorul Oficial, №. 100-102. art. 613, 1998). Specifically, parties needed members to reside in at least half of the second-level administrative-territorial units, with a minimum of 150 members in each. The 2008 Law on Political Parties (LPP) slightly moderated these requirements, reducing the minimum to 4,000 members and 120 members per district (Monitorul Oficial, №. 42-44, art. 119, 2008). However, as this analysis demonstrates, even these adjusted requirements remained notably stringent in a regional context.\nComparative analysis of registration requirements\n      Figure 1 presents the minimum number of members required for party registration across post-communist regimes since the early 1990s. While Moldova ranks 13th in raw numbers, this metric alone provides an incomplete picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cross-national and cross-temporal variation in party registration requirements (numbr of signatures) across post-communist regimes 1990-2019\n\n\n\n      A more nuanced understanding emerges when we consider these requirements in relation to each country’s electoral market. Figure 2 illustrates this relationship by showing the ratio between registered voters and required members. This analysis reveals Moldova holds the third position in terms of stringency of registration requirements, trailing only behind Kazakhstan (2002-2019) and Slovakia (2005-2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cross-national and cross-temporal variation in the stringency of party registration requirements across post-communist regimes 1990-2019\n\n\n\n      In practical terms, a new party in Moldova needed to recruit one member from every 608 registered voters when the new LPP was adopted in 2008. This challenge becomes even more daunting when one considers migration and other voter related registration issues. Figure 3 provides an integrated perspective, combining the insights from Figures 1 and 2 to demonstrate how raw membership requirements and voter pool size interact to create varying levels of accessibility for new political parties across different countries. On the X-axis is shows the size of the voters’ pool in registered voters, on the Y-axis there are signature requirements while the size of the bubbles indicate the stringency of registration requirement. The larger the bubble the more effort newly aspiring political parties need to deploy to recruit potential members. As one may notice, Moldova is among those political regimes placing a heavier burden to achieve this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Cross-national variation in the stringency of party registration requirements across post-communist regimes 1990-2019 relative to the size of voters’ pool and signature requirements\n\n\n\nTerritorial distribution requirements\n      The territorial representation requirement introduced in 1998 added another significant barrier to party registration since they needed at least 120 members residing in half of the second-tier administrative units (districts). While the 1999 ruling of the Constitutional Court upheld this requirement, finding it consistent with freedom of association (Curtea Constituțională, 1999), it represents another hurdle for the emergence of new parties. The “territorial representation” requirement is less widespread across post-communist world. Out of 27 countries, only 10 have implemented such a rule, but Moldova’s version stands among the strictest. Figure 4 shows that among the ten post-communist countries that implemented territorial requirements, Moldova’s were among the most demanding, particularly when considering the size of its electorate. Only Romania imposed comparable territorial requirements, mandating at least 700 members in each of 18 counties. Notably, several countries have moved away from such requirements – Russia, for instance, abandoned territorial representation rules after 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Cross-national variation in the stringency of party registration requirements based on territorial distribution of membership across post-communist regimes 1990-2019\n\n\n\nA new constitutional shift\n      A significant shift occurred in 2020 when Moldova’s Constitutional Court ruled that both the 4,000-member requirement and the territorial representation condition were excessively restrictive and unconstitutional (Curtea Constituțională, 2020). This landmark decision acknowledged that these requirements created disproportionate barriers to political participation and association.\n\nImplications for democratic development\n\n      This analysis demonstrates that Moldova’s party registration requirements, prior to the 2020 Constitutional Court decision, placed it among the most restrictive regimes in the post-communist space. The combined effect of high membership thresholds and territorial distribution requirements created substantial barriers to entry for new political forces, potentially hampering political pluralism and democratic development. The Court’s 2020 decision represents a significant step toward aligning Moldova’s party registration framework with democratic principles and regional best practices.This constitutional shift highlights the need to carefully calibrate party registration requirements: they must be robust enough to ensure genuine political commitment while remaining accessible enough to foster democratic pluralism, participation and competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCurtea Constituțională.

The size of the bubbles, represents the percentage of voters from which to recruit a single member and reflects, the effort required by newly aspiring political organisations to recruit potential members from the voters’ pool. The larger the bubbles, the more burdensome are party registration provisions, thus demanding more efforts on behalf of new political parties. Additionally, the higher the number of signatures for the “Territorial distribution” axis, the more difficult for new parties to register.
